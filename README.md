I have created a Wordle program using python and tkinter. The program consists of three classes: word, player, and game, along with a format file to store fonts and colors.
DISCLAIMER: In order to generate the random words, I had to use the built-in requests function to access a public file "https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt" which
is a compilation of numerous 5-letter words. All credits for the file goes towards Stanford's CS faculty.
